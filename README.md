**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Lab02 Link on the Course Schedule to accept this
        assignment as you did for Lab01. Once accepted, code up a
        complete solution to the above assignment specification. Your
        complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that Java is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic pdf (punetidLab02Change.pdf) of your program is to be emailed to ryandj@pacificu.edu**
